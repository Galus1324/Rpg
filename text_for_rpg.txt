What is your name?
=== intro ===
You are resting in a tavern from a long adventure you just came back from recently.
To you comes a grumpy and tired-looking dwarf bartender and asks you:
Bartender: Do you want anything to drink?
Bartender: I have got beer and mead but don't ask for anything fancier than that cuz I don't have it!
=== beer ===
Bartender: Good choice!
Bartender: All our beer comes from locals just a couple minutes from here.
Bartender: Many strong heroes like yourself have enjoyed the beer here.
Bartender: Here you go and enjoy!
=== mead ===
Bartender: Eh mead, was never a big fan of the drink.
Bartender: It is just too sweet for me.
Bartender: I like more erm how would I say manly drinks like beer.
Bartender: It is nice and bitter.
=== nothing ===
Bartender: An adventurer that refuses a drink?
Bartender: What kind of an adventurer even are you?
=== bartender_talk ===
Bartender: Anyways, have you heard that there has been a tomb found near our little village?
Bartender: Yea, it is rumored that it was created by an ancient lich.
Bartender: The tomb only accepts one adventurer at a time.
Bartender: The one who can get out of it alive will gain enormous wealth if the writings on the tomb walls are to be trusted.
Bartender: I have seen many heroes go and try to clear the tomb but none had succeeded yet.
Bartender: Are you gonna try, young adventurer?
=== toa_yes ===
Bartender: Oh, you must be brave, or are you just so desperate for money?
Bartender: Who knows well anyways got to go help other customers.
=== toa_no ===
Bartender: Well, an honest answer and the one I like as the dead customers don't spend much money.
Bartender: Just promise to protect my tavern if anything crawls out of it.
=== drink_yes ===
After drinking your drink, you leave the tavern.
=== drink_no ===
After that conversation, you leave the tavern.
 === outside_village ===
when you come outside the tavern you see the sun shining in a beautiful spring morning.
before you could go anywhere you see a small child with ragged clothes running towards you and saying:
Eirlys: Hello I am Eirlys.
Eirlys: And I really really need your help.
Eirlys: My father went to the Tomb of annihilation so that our family could finally eat every day.
Eirlys: But he hasn't come back.
Eirlys: so {player_name}, will you save him?
Eirlys: I know that you are a strong hero.
=== help_eirlys ===
Eirlys: Yes, I knew I could rely on you {player_name}.
Eirlys: So let me give you some tips before you venture on.
Eirlys: Here is the map to the Tomb of annihilation.
Eirlys: Its only a couple of hours on foot from where we are right now.
Eirlys: I wish you the best of luck!
Eirlys: Goodbye!
=== no_help_eirlys ===
The child says fuck you as he kicks you in your leg before running away.
=== stay_in_the_village ===
You are still in the village.
there are multiple things you can do here.
You can visit the blacksmith, the general merchaint go back to the tavern
or just wonder around and serching for more information regarding the Tomb of annihilation.
=== go_to_blacksmith ===
you come to the Sally's magical forge. The workshop ran by a cheerful half-orc named Sally. 
The exterior features a whimsy anvil sign, hinting at the warmth within. When you come Inside,
the rhythmic sounds of hammer on metal mixed with Sally's hearty laughter immediately get you into a better mood.
The space is well organized, with every tool neatly placed on its designated spot
and a well-worn anvil that takes center stage.  
Sally: Hello welcome to Sally's magical forge what has brought you here?
=== upgrade_1 ===
Sally: Oh yes I can see that your gear is quite worn i will fix it right away!
Sally: Here you go im sure it is even shinier than the day you bought it.
Sally: Don't worry about paying first time is on the house.
Sally: But come back to me if you need anything else.
=== blacksmith_talk_1 ===
Sally: Yes, I have got a lot more business than usually.
Sally: Did you know that just yesterday a realy weird man came to me he was muttering something about feeding his family.
Sally: He only bought a realy small knife and left.
=== blacksmith_leave === 
Sally: Have a great day adventurer!
You come out to the streets of the village.
=== go_to_merchaint ===
You walk to The Devilish Deals Depot.
A small shop near Sally's magical forge, run by a charismatic tiefling named Redos Firewhip. 
You come inside and see that it is filled with more exotic trinkets then you would expect from a small village shop like this.
The tiefling merchant, with curled horns and a sly grin
weaves tales and engages patrons in lively banter, turning every purchase into a theatrical exchange.
When he sees you he says:
Redos Firewhip: What has brought you into my humble little store?
=== Merchaint_buy ===
Redos Firewhip: Hmmm?
Redos Firewhip: I suppose you wouldn't be interesting in any of my other crap.
Redos Firewhip: So here.
shows you a healing potion and a ring of protection
Redos Firewhip: But you only have enough money for one so choose wisely!
=== ring_of_protection ===
Redos Firewhip: Excellent choice!
Redos Firewhip: The ring will protect you on all of your upcoming battles.
=== potion_of_healing ===
Redos Firewhip: Excellent choice!
Redos Firewhip: Just remember once you use it it's gone so use it when you realy need to.
=== what_am_i ===
Redos Firewhip: I am a tiefling of many tales, weaving magic into everyday wares at the Devilish Deals Depot. 
Redos Firewhip: Horns curled and grin sly, I blend enchantment with mischief. Visit my vibrant emporium in the heart of the village,
Redos Firewhip: where every purchase becomes a pact of charm and curious delight.
=== tiefling_story ===
Redos Firewhip: In the shadowy realm of the Nine Hells, Asmodeus, the Archduke, forged pacts with mortal sorcerers.
Redos Firewhip: Offering arcane might, these ambitious mortals pledged their souls.
Redos Firewhip: From this infernal communion, the tieflings were bornâ€”descendants marked with horns and an otherworldly aura.
Redos Firewhip: Asmodeus, with a sly grin, shares the cosmic interplay that binds tieflings to both infernal and mortal destinies.
Redos Firewhip: The tale unravels a complex dance of power, ambition, and the enduring connection between realms.
=== merchaint_leave ===
you leave his not so humble store and go back to the streets from where you already hear the blacksmith again.
