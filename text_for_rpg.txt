What is your name?
=== intro ===
You are resting in a tavern from a long adventure you just came back from recently.
To you comes a grumpy and tired-looking dwarf bartender and asks you:
Bartender: Do you want anything to drink?
Bartender: I have got beer and mead but don't ask for anything fancier than that cuz I don't have it!
=== beer ===
Bartender: Good choice!
Bartender: All our beer comes from locals just a couple minutes from here.
Bartender: Many strong heroes like yourself have enjoyed the beer here.
Bartender: Here you go and enjoy!
=== mead ===
Bartender: Eh mead, was never a big fan of the drink.
Bartender: It is just too sweet for me.
Bartender: I like more erm how would I say manly drinks like beer.
Bartender: It is nice and bitter.
=== nothing ===
Bartender: An adventurer that refuses a drink?
Bartender: What kind of an adventurer even are you?
=== bartender_talk ===
Bartender: Anyways, have you heard that there has been a tomb found near our little village?
Bartender: Yea, it is rumored that it was created by an ancient lich.
Bartender: The tomb only accepts one adventurer at a time.
Bartender: The one who can get out of it alive will gain enormous wealth if the writings on the tomb walls are to be trusted.
Bartender: I have seen many heroes go and try to clear the tomb but none had succeeded yet.
Bartender: Are you gonna try, young adventurer?
=== toa_yes ===
Bartender: Oh, you must be brave, or are you just so desperate for money?
Bartender: Who knows well anyways got to go help other customers.
=== toa_no ===
Bartender: Well, an honest answer and the one I like as the dead customers don't spend much money.
Bartender: Just promise to protect my tavern if anything crawls out of it.
=== drink_yes ===
After drinking your drink, you leave the tavern.
=== drink_no ===
After that conversation, you leave the tavern.
 === outside_village ===
when you come outside the tavern you see the sun shining in a beautiful spring morning.
before you could go anywhere you see a small child with ragged clothes running towards you and saying:
Eirlys: Hello I am Eirlys.
Eirlys: And I really really need your help.
Eirlys: My father went to the Tomb of annihilation so that our family could finally eat every day.
Eirlys: But he hasn't come back.
Eirlys: so {player_name}, will you save him?
Eirlys: I know that you are a strong hero.
=== help_eirlys ===
Eirlys: Yes, I knew i could rely on you {player_name}.
Eirlys: So let me give you some tips before you venture on.
Eirlys: Here is the map to the Tomb of annihilation.
Eirlys: Its only a couple of hours on foot from where we are right now.
Eirlys: I wish you the best of luck!
Eirlys: Goodbye!

The child says fuck you as he kicks you in your leg before running away.

=== go_to_blacksmith ===
you travel a couple hundred meters to the Sally's magical forge. The workshop ran by a cheerful half-orc named Sally. 
The exterior features a whimsy anvil sign, hinting at the warmth within. When you come Inside,
the rhythmic sounds of hammer on metal mixed with Sally's hearty laughter immediately get you into a better mood.
The space is well organized, with every tool neatly placed on its designated spot
and a well-worn anvil that takes center stage.  
Sally: Hello welcome to Sally's magical forge what has brought you here?
=== upgrade_1 ===
Sally: Oh yes I can see that your gear is quite worn i will fix it right away!
Sally: Here you go im sure it is even shinier than the day you bought it.
Sally: Don't worry about paying first time is on the house.
Sally: But come back to me if you need anything else.
=== blacksmith_talk_1 ===
Sally: Yes, I have got a lot more business than usually.
Sally: Did you know that just yesterday a realy weird man came to me he was muttering something about feeding his family.
Sally: He only bought a realy small knife and left.
=== blacksmith_go_away === 
Sally: Have a great day adventurer!
You come out to the streets of the village.
