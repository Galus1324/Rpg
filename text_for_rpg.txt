Bartender: The tomb only accepts one adventurer at a time.
Bartender: The one who can get out of it alive will gain enormous wealth if the writings on the tomb walls are to be trusted.
Bartender: I have seen many heroes go and try to clear the tomb but none had succeeded yet.
Bartender: Are you gonna try, young adventurer?
=== toa_yes ===
Bartender: Oh, you must be brave, or are you just so desperate for money?
Bartender: Who knows well anyways got to go help other customers.

Eirlys: Hello I am Eirlys.
Eirlys: And I really really need your help.
Eirlys: My father went to the Tomb of annihilation so that our family could finally eat every day.

or just wonder around and searching for more information regarding the Tomb of annihilation.
=== go_to_blacksmith ===
you come to the Sally's magical forge. The workshop ran by a cheerful half-orc named Sally. 
The exterior features a whimsy anvil sign, hinting at the warmth within. When you come Inside,
the rhythmic sounds of hammer on metal mixed with Sally's hearty laughter immediately get you into a better mood.
The space is well organized, with every tool neatly placed on its designated spot
and a well-worn anvil that takes center stage.  
Sally: Hello welcome to Sally's magical forge what has brought you here?
=== upgrade_1 ===
Sally: Oh yes I can see that your gear is quite worn i will fix it right away!

=== blacksmith_leave === 
Sally: Have a great day adventurer!
You come out to the streets of the village.
=== go_to_merchant ===
You walk to The Devilish Deals Depot.
A small shop near Sally's magical forge, run by a charismatic tiefling named Redos Firewhip. 
You come inside and see that it is filled with more exotic trinkets then you would expect from a small village shop like this.
The tiefling merchant, with curled horns and a sly grin
weaves tales and engages patrons in lively banter, turning every purchase into a theatrical exchange.
When he sees you he says:
Redos Firewhip: What has brought you into my humble little store?
=== Merchant_buy ===
Redos Firewhip: Hmmm?
Redos Firewhip: I suppose you wouldn't be interesting in any of my other crap.
Redos Firewhip: So here.

=== what_am_i ===
Redos Firewhip: I am a tiefling of many tales, weaving magic into everyday wares at the Devilish Deals Depot. 
Redos Firewhip: Horns curled and grin sly, I blend enchantment with mischief. Visit my vibrant emporium in the heart of the village,
Redos Firewhip: where every purchase becomes a pact of charm and curious delight.
=== tiefling_story ===
Redos Firewhip: In the shadowy realm of the Nine Hells, Asmodeus, the Archduke, forged pacts with mortal sorcerers.
Redos Firewhip: Offering arcane might, these ambitious mortals pledged their souls.
Redos Firewhip: From this infernal communion, the tieflings were born-descendants marked with horns and an otherworldly aura.
Redos Firewhip: Asmodeus, with a sly grin, shares the cosmic interplay that binds tieflings to both infernal and mortal destinies.
